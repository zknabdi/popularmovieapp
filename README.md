# Popular Movies App
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.


## Project Overview
**Stage 1:  Main Discovery Screen, A Details View, and Settings**
  **User Experience**
    In this stage you’ll build the core experience of your movies app.

## Why this Project

Upon launch, present the user with an grid arrangement of movie posters.
    Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
          The sort order can be by most popular, or by top rated
    Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
           original title
           movie poster image thumbnail
           A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
           user rating (called vote_average in the api)
           release date
